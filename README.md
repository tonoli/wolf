# Wolf

This is a very basic raycasting program I implemented. For now it's not even better that the Windows 95's screen saver... It's the alpha version I want to make a lot of improvements in the next months to explore possibilities. 

If still you want to play arround with it here the installation process

* Install

Download/clone this repo:

	git clone https://github.com/tonoli/wolf
	
Get into it and build:
	
	cd wolf
	make

Give it some time to compile all the files. 

BOOM ./wolf3d is ready to be used!


Alright, now we have a `wolf3d` executable in your directory. Now test it with:

	./wolf3d maps/lvl1.w3d

You should have something like this ðŸ‘‡Â
